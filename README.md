 - Welcome to the Learning Management System (LMS) Project!

This project, initiated as part of a Master's Degree in Computer Science, specializing in Software Engineering at ACT, represents a comprehensive exploration of educational software development. Developed with precision using Python and the Django framework, supplemented by the Django Rest Framework (DRF), this LMS is designed to provide an efficient and user-friendly platform for managing learning resources.

### Key Features:
    Python and Django Framework: Leveraging the power of Python and the robustness of the Django framework to ensure a scalable and maintainable backend.
    Django Rest Framework (DRF): Facilitating API access, allowing seamless communication between the backend and external applications or interfaces.

This repository serves as a testament to the commitment to excellence and innovation in software engineering education. Feel free to explore the codebase, contribute, and engage in the ongoing journey of enhancing educational technology.

Clone, learn, contribute, and let's elevate the learning experience together!
